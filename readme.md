### What is it?
---

**Who Da Best at Fifa? is an online leaderboard for Fifa players (if you don't know what Fifa is check it out [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_14). It was a simple project I did over the summer of 2014. The endgoal was to get familiar with web design and Ruby on Rails.

For those who know all about it, Fifa creates alot of agruments around one central question: Who really is the best player amongst your friends? Instead of bragging about your skills with no stats to back you up, this website takes care of ranking players instantaneously after each game they play. Simply join a group, add your friends to it and continue playing your favorite game! You finally have a way to really know if you're the best!**
